"""Psychometric HTTP surface — PHQ-9, GAD-7, WHO-5, AUDIT-C, C-SSRS,
PSS-10, DAST-10.

Single ``POST /v1/assessments`` endpoint dispatches by ``instrument``
key.  Each instrument has its own validated item count and item-value
range; the dispatch layer picks the right scorer and renders a unified
response shape.

Response shape additions over the original phq9/gad7-only design:
- ``index``: the WHO-5 Index value (raw_total × 4).  Optional because
  no other instrument uses an index conversion.  Clients reading WHO-5
  scores MUST display ``index``, not ``total`` — the published cutoffs
  are on the index scale.
- ``cutoff_used`` + ``positive_screen``: AUDIT-C-only fields surfacing
  the sex-aware cutoff that was applied.  Clients render the cutoff
  in the result UI ("positive at ≥ N").
- ``triggering_items``: C-SSRS-only — the 1-indexed item numbers that
  drove the risk band.  Clinician-facing UI renders these as the
  "these answers escalated this screen" audit trail.
- ``instrument_version``: pinned version string for downstream storage
  and FHIR Observation export.

Idempotency:
- The ``Idempotency-Key`` header is required.  Re-sending the same key
  with the same body yields the same response (the route is currently
  stateless — repository wiring to enforce this lands when the
  AssessmentRepository ships).

Safety routing:
- PHQ-9 runs through the item-9 classifier (single item positive →
  T3 check per Kroenke 2001).
- C-SSRS runs through its own triage rules: items 4/5 positive OR
  item 6 positive with ``behavior_within_3mo=True`` → T3.
- GAD-7, WHO-5, AUDIT-C, PSS-10, DAST-10 have no safety items —
  ``requires_t3`` is always False for these instruments.  WHO-5 ``depression_screen`` band is *not* a T3
  trigger; T3 is reserved for active suicidality per
  Docs/Whitepapers/04_Safety_Framework.md §T3.

C-SSRS transport note:
- Clients send item responses as 0/1 ints (consistent with every other
  instrument).  The scorer coerces to bool internally; the response
  echoes the raw caller input in the stored record.
